# Welcome to OCCSVG

OCCSVGViewer is a Windows GUI that uses the <b>OCCSVG</b> package to render SVG files. The OCCSVG NuGet package, available at: <code style="color : red">Missing link to download from NuGet</code>, is designed to read SVG files and import their various elements into a .NET application. 

This package is built upon several key technologies: .Net, C#, C++/CLI and Occt.NET (version 7.9.0) based on Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), also available from: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Occt.NET

OCCSVG can accurately read shapes defined in SVG files, including their strokes, fills, and other properties. 
It supports most types of gradients, patterns, which gives designers the freedom to define their drawings in almost any vector drawing application and save them into SVG file. 
Application developers can then use the drawings in their .NET applications.
